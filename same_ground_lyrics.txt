My love, it's been a long time since I cried and left you out of the blue
It's hard leaving you that way when I never wanted to
Self-denial is a game it's strange I never would've ceased
'Til you came and rendered me release

'Cause now I'm finding myself in the middle of the rain
And I can't let you go, no, I can't let you go
Now I'm finding myself in the middle of the rain
And I can't let you go, no, I can't let you go
Tried so hard to be strong
To let you know that I can make it on my own (Same ground)

Unless you say it's just a game
And I will play it all the same
Unless you say it's just a game
And I will play it all the same
